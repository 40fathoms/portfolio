        description: "Cultivated the student's potential using a methodology that contextualizes the subjects, facilitating their understanding and improving student performance. From march 2019 to june 2019 I tutored a student applying for a civil service examination. Worked content included high school level AP Physics 1 and 2. From august 2019 to may 2020 I tutored an undergraduate civil engineering student. Worked content included AP Physics 2 (thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, waves and sounds, electricity and magnetism)."
